# Flash Card App
A series of questions are loaded in from a text file to populate the flash card set. The user must think of each answer before revealing and select whether or not they were able to answer correctly. Once a question has been answered correctly 3 times, that question is removed from the set. The questions will continue to iterate until they are all removed from the set.
